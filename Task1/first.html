    <h1>VCS implementation using GitHub</h1>
    <br>
    <h1>Tutorial:</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Today we'll be learning on how to use GitHub step by step,</p>
    <p> assuming you have already created your project and want to upload it to GitHub</p>
    <br>
    <h2>Step 1:  Create a repository.</h2>
    <p>We can either create a repository or clone it from a one created,</p>
    <p>for the sake of this tutorial we'll clone a repository.</p>

    <p>as shown in the above diagram click on <strong>New</strong> to create a new repository </p>
    <p>Next you have to give your repository a name and make it public if you want others to see it as well as shown below.</p>

    <p>Perfect now we have successfully created a repository</p>
    <p>It will look something like this.</p>

    <h2>Step 2:  Commit the files.</h2>
    <p>Copy the <strong>HTPS</strong >.</p>
    <p>Open CMD or 'git bash' in the folder where you have stored the project files </p> 
    <p>and type in <strong>'git init'</strong> as shown in the picture below.</p>
    <img src="/hassanPUCIT/Task1/img4.png" alt="" height="400" width="800">
    <p> now type in <strong>'git add .'</strong> which will add all the files in the respective directory.</p>
    <img src="/hassanPUCIT/Task1/img5.png" alt="" height="400">
    <p>based on your project directories cmd may show different output, as for my case I only have one folder.</p>
    <p>now we will commit the files and you have type along a msg as shown below. </p>
